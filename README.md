Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the art of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining of software applications or programs. 
In the tech industry, software engineering has the following importance:
1. Improved Problem Solving Skils - Every day, Programmers (Software Developers) tackle complex codes, algorithms, and each time, they are able to learn and adapt to be better problem solvers. The enhanced problem solving skills enables them to produce better, clearer and good applications, which in turn users love and when the users win, the developers also win. This is of importance.
2. Enhanced Software development - It's not once or twice we've had a negative experience while using a software or doing somethings manually (tiring, time consuming, etc.,). Software engineering has led to the development of better and efficient software applications, which has enabled smoother user experience making life easier. Furthermore, some things that were done manually have now been actualized into softwares, making it easier, faster, and accurate to do them. All this has been made possible by Software Engineering.
3. Increased Revenue Generation - Software engineering has led to the development of softwares which has led to increased turnovers over the years. This has been primarily important as it has led to better research, more technological advancements, which in turn has made life way easier and efficient.
4. Need for better computer systems - Software engineering has led to the rise or need for better computer systems which the engineers will use to run their day to day software developmemt activities. This is important as it makes the tech industry a lucrative and fun business. Furthermore, the need has led to better research and increased job opportunities for Engineers. 
   

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Security Risks - since there are increased cyber attack threats, it is necessary to keep the software up to date with security improvements and all.
2. Bugs and Errors - With time, outdated software starts experiencing bugs and errors that were intially there. It is up to the developers to keep the system up to date to avoid unnecessary conflicts with users and new environments.
3. New Functionality and Features - When there are new features to be added to the existing software, there will be a new version of the software when the feautures are updated. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases are:
1. Planning - this process involves understanding what the software will entail, and why the software is needed. Here, the developers will ask themselves the questions, "What benefit will the system have to the user?" and "What value will it offer to the user?". This enables them to craft a software that is needed and has importance to end users.
2. Requirements Analysis - after the planning phase, there is the requirement analysis phase which involves identifying the needs or requirements of the end users. This is of importance as it enables the developer(s) to craft or understand fully what the user needs and as such, they can craft the software to meet the user's needs.
3. Design - This involves developing the framework for the software. Things such as the structure, navigation, outlook, User Interface (UI), database design etc., are identified and recorded. It is of importance as it will lead to the creation of a user-friendly software.
4. Coding - This process/phase involves translating the theory/idea into a code that is tangible which can be run and be debugged. It follows all the elements that were identified in the design phase.
5. Testing - Once the coding phase is complete, the code is passed through something like, "Quality-Control" which enables them to check for bugs and other things (user experience, UI, speed, etc.,). Furthermore, tests such as integrity, security, agility, and acceptance testing are done. If they are any issues or bugs identified, they are recorded and worked on to get a quality inspected code that meets all the objectives and requirements it was set to do.
6. Deployment - Once all the tests and debugging have been done, the polished end product is released to the end/final users for them to use it.
7. Maintenance and continous development - With time, the end users may identify bugs or other issues that may arise, those issues are debugged  in this phase. And if there are new features added to the product, they are added and worked on in this phase while following the initial 6 steps.
   

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Comparing the two methodoligies, they have the similarity of using different routes, but same destination. In the end, the software would be developed and it will possess all the requirement a good software should have. 

The differences is that, in Waterfall methodology, it is a linear and sequential approach whereas one step must be completed to move to the next development step whereas in Agile, it is an iterative and incremental approach that calls for interaction and collaboration between a multi-disciplinary team. 

Waterfall methodology would be appropriate in the production of a simple software that does not have many requirements, an example is developing of a simple calculator software or Notebook. 

Agile methodology would be appropriate in the production of a complex software with many requirements and a big budget. An example is the development of a Graphic design software such as Photoshop, AutoCAD and mathematical simulation software like MATLAB. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer does the following: 
1. Laying out of the software design.
2. Coding the design(s) into tangible code.
3. debugging and testing of the code at different stages in the coding phase.
4. Continous improvement and learning.

The quality Assurance has the following roles: 
1. Check the quality of the product pushed by the software development team. To check if the product given is what the user needs or will like.
2. Carry out all the necessary testing (security, agility, etc.,) on the Software pushed and to report any observations or issues to the necessary team.
3. Review documentation and user interface for consistency.

The Project Manager has the following roles: 
1. Guiding and providing motivation to the software development teams and solving any conflicts that may arise.
2. Monitoring the software development progress, ensuring it's in line with the set time plans and if they are any deficiencies, he/she notes and works on them.
3. Monitoring the allocated budget, ensuring it fits and they are no extra expenses that will strain the budget.
4. Coordinate with the QA engineer to ensure the development project meets the set standards.
    


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated development Environments (IDEs) are important in the software development process as they: 
1. They simplify the process of writing code. Some IDEs offer suggestions when coding and this improves the speed and accuracy in which code is written.
2. They make debugging easy. IDEs are able to catch lines where "error" causing issues are. This helps programmers know where to focus on their lines and code, this leads to the production of better code and there's not time wasting on either side.
3. They help programmers in organizing of their code and work in an efficient way.

examples of IDEs are Visual Studio (VS) code, Pycharm, C compiler. 

Version Control Systems (VCS) are important in the software development process as: 
1. Enhances the project development speed by providing efficient collaboration between multi-disciplinary teams.
2. Reduce possibilities of errors and conflicts meanwhile project development through traceability to every small changes.
3. In case of any disaster or a contingent situation, it makes it easy for the restore or recover the files before changes were done.
4. When working as a multi-disciplinary team, it enables one to see who did what changes.
An example of VCS is GitHub. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges faced by Software Engineers are:
1. Changing requirements - in the current world, the software engineering field is changing and growing at an exponential rate. It sometimes proves difficult for the software engineer to keep up with the changing things in his/her field.
2. Tight Deadlines - The process of producing software is not as easy, and sometimes the tasks prove to be complex such that the engineers have to deliver within a specific period. This proves to be too tight for them and they have stressful days before the software is fully ready.
3. System Security - In a world where they are many hackers and all, it sometimes proves it difficult for the engineers to fully protect their software.
4. Lack of Support - sometimes engineers don't get the support they need from their seniors (project engineers) and this brings in excessive pressure to them as they are working. Working under pressure decreases their output greatly.

This challenges can be overcome by:
1. Field Specialization - Software developers can specialize within one field area, making it easier for them to master it and keep up with the changes coming within their field.
2. Proper Work Plan - the developer should develop a complete work plan and they should monitor their progress using it. If they are a few steps behind, they should figure out ways of making sure they are up to date with the plan. With proper planning, tight deadlines should not worry them much.
3. Working as a team - If the works are commplex and the deadlines are tight, the developers can work as a team whereas they'll divide and conquer the work, making sure they are no stressful situations when dealing with the deadlines.
4. Requesting for support - whenever the software developers feel negleted by their seniors, they should speak out and talk to them to find a solution.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

The different types of testing are:
1. Unit testing - this type of testing involves segmenting the whole code into smaller segments that are tested individually to make sure they work as required.
2. Integration testing - this type of testing involves testing how two or more software units interact with one another.
3. Systen testing - this type involves testing the whole finished code/software.
4. Acceptance testing - this involves testing according to the user requirements and needs.

The importance of these tests to the QA is that they:
1. Enable him/her to perform all the necessary tests, leading to a completely bug free application.
2. Enable the QA to detect bugs easily and faster, reducing the workload.
3. Reduce the maintenance costs of the software. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of interacting with AI models in a way that they give the most efficient and precise response available. 

Their Importance is: 
1. Improved user experience - the user is able to get responses that are accurate and suited to his/her needs without necessary having to tweak them each time.
2. Reduced Biasness - the user is able to descibe what they really want, and as such, it will lead to results that have reduced biasness. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: I'm bored. 

Improved Prompt: I'm bored in my house. Kindly provide some fun at home to do cooking activities(recipies), they shouldn't be hard to do, risky, and time consuming. Keep it simple. 

I think my improved prompt is effective in that it clear, specific (cooking), it shows where I'm at and it's precise.
